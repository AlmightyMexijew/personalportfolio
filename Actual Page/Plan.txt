User Stories and Plan:

Plan: To build a personal portfolio from scratch
Method: We will build a basic portfolio using HTML,CSS,JS.  Each task will be broken into it's cursory parts and elements. From there further breakdown will occur until we fill in the code. At the end, we will unite all the pieces back together and put them into a DOM. This will be hosted in private and be what we send out. Examples will be drawn from all over my portfolio and filesystem. We will organize them into a list by name and location for further organizational purposes that will simplify how we find them.
